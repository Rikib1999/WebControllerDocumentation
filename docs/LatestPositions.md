 **`LatestPositions.vue`** component is responsible for displaying the latest positions of players (or other entities) on a map. The map is represented by an image that is rendered on a canvas element, and the positions are drawn on top of the map in real time.

---

## Features

- **Map Rendering**: Displays a map image scaled to fit within specified maximum dimensions while maintaining aspect ratio.
- **Position Display**: Plots positions on the map, representing players or objects.
- **Path Drawing**: Draws lines (paths) showing the movement history of each player.
- **Direction Arrows**: Shows the orientation of players using arrows based on rotation data.
- **Dynamic Updates**: Automatically updates the display when new position data or a new map is received.
- **Scaling and Offsets**: Adjusts positions based on real-world dimensions and optional offsets to align the map correctly.

## Logic Overview

### **Props**
- **mapUrl**: The URL of the map image to display. This is a required prop.
- **realWidth**: The real-world width of the map, used to calculate the scale of the map on the canvas.
- **realHeight**: The real-world height of the map, used to calculate the scale of the map on the canvas.
- **maxWidth**: The maximum width of the map on the canvas. Default is 500.
- **maxHeight**: The maximum height of the map on the canvas. Default is 500.
- **offsetX**: A horizontal offset in Unity units applied to all player positions when rendering. Default is 0.
- **offsetY**: A vertical offset in Unity units applied to all player positions when rendering. Default is 0.
- **offsetRot**: A rotation offset in degrees applied to the player positions when rendering. Default is 0.
- **positions**: An array of position data that includes information like coordinates (`posX`, `posZ`), rotation (`rotY`), and other player-specific data. It is required and must be passed to the component.

The array of position objects has the following structure:

```json
{
  [
    [
      {
        "index": 0,
        "posX": 10,
        "posZ": 20,
        "rotY": 45,
        "latestPositionColor": { "r": 255, "g": 0, "b": 0, "a": 1 },
        "olderPositionsColor": { "r": 255, "g": 165, "b": 0, "a": 0.8 },
        "pathColor": { "r": 255, "g": 165, "b": 0, "a": 0.6 }
      },
      // More positions...
    ],
    // More players...
  ]
}
```

### **Data**
- **img**: Holds the image object for the map image.
- **imgWidth**: The width of the map image after scaling.
- **imgHeight**: The height of the map image after scaling.
- **scaleX**: Horizontal scale factor to adjust the real-world coordinates to fit the canvas.
- **scaleY**: Vertical scale factor to adjust the real-world coordinates to fit the canvas.

### **Computed Properties**
- **groupedPositions**: Groups the position data by player index, making it easier to manage the positions for each player.

### **Watchers**
- **positions**: Watches for changes in the `positions` prop and updates the map when the positions are updated.
- **mapUrl**: Watches for changes in the `mapUrl` prop. If the map URL changes, it reloads the map image and re-renders the canvas.

### **Methods**
- **drawMap**: Draws the map image onto the canvas. It resizes the image to fit within the maximum width and height constraints while maintaining the aspect ratio.
- **updateLatestPositions**: Updates the canvas with the new position data. It redraws the map and then draws the new positions on top of it.
- **drawPositions**: Draws the paths, dots, and arrows for each player's position on the canvas. It handles grouping and rendering of player movements, colors, line widths, and direction arrows.
- **drawArrowWithDot**: Draws an arrow on the canvas to represent the player's direction of movement, along with a dot to represent the current position.
- **setMap**: Loads the map image from the provided URL, scales it to fit the canvas dimensions, and updates the canvas size and scale factors.

### **Lifecycle Hooks**
- **mounted**: Calls the `setMap` method when the component is mounted to the DOM, initializing the canvas and loading the map image.

### **Canvas Drawing**
- The map image is drawn on the canvas first.
- The positions are drawn on top of the map:
  - **Paths**: A line is drawn between consecutive positions to represent the player's movement.
  - **Dots**: A dot is drawn at each position to mark the player's location.
  - **Arrows**: An arrow is drawn to show the direction of movement, with the rotation based on the `rotY` value.

### **Additional Notes**
- The component supports real-time updates to the positions, with new positions being rendered as soon as they are available.
- The map is responsive, with its size adjusted based on the `maxWidth` and `maxHeight` constraints while maintaining the aspect ratio.

### **Usage**

To use the **LatestPositions.vue** component, you need to pass the required props:

```vue
<LatestPositions
  :positions="positionsData"
  :mapUrl="mapImageUrl"
  :realWidth="mapRealWidth"
  :realHeight="mapRealHeight"
  :maxWidth="800"
  :maxHeight="600"
  :offsetX="mapOffsetX"
  :offsetY="mapOffsetY"
  :offsetRot="mapRotationOffset"
/>
```
